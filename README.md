Developing a 3D game with Raycasting in C programming language.

## My steps

#### 1. Learn what raycasting is. 
 So basically, you should learn or remember basics of trigonometry. Because all raycasting is based on angels and triangles. 
 Try to remember how to find angles with cos, sin, tan, ctn.
